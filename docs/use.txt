This plugin is enabled by default and will make `nose` respect modules
that contain unit tests but define a function that returns the suite
containing those tests rather than expecting the test runner to
collect them directly.

The name of this function is expected to be ``test_suite`` by default,
if you require a different name to be used, please invoke nose as
follows::

  $ nosetests --test-suite-func=your_func_name

By default, it will also prevent docstrings in tests from being used as
test names in the test run output. You can turn this behaviour off by
passing the ``--show-docstrings`` option on the command-line.
